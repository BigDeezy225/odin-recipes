        <h3>Steps</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Pour in olive oil and heat until sizzling; add meat and season with salt and pepper. Cook until browned, 5 to 7 minutes per side.</li>

            <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes more. Unlock and remove the lid.</li>
